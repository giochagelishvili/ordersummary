# Order Summary Component

I am thrilled to present my project, a responsive and interactive order summary webpage that I crafted using HTML and CSS. The inspiration for this design was derived from a Figma concept, which I adapted to create a seamless and engaging user experience.

Although the design was not particularly complex, I am pleased with the end result and the opportunity it presented to further develop my skills in web development and design. I look forward to tackling more challenging projects in the future and continuing to refine my craft.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my work.
